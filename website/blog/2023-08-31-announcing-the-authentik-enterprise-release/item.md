üì£ We are happy to announce that the first authentik Enterprise release is here! üéâ
The Enterprise release of authentik provides all of the functionality that we have spent years building in our open source product, plus dedicated support and account management.
This preview version is available with our latest release, 2023.8. To upgrade and get going refer to our technical documentation for instructions for your environment.

-   [Docker Compose installation](../docs/installation/docker-compose)
    [Kubernetes installation](../docs/installation/kubernetes)
    Keeping it simple, we made sure that installing and upgrading authentik is exactly the same process for both Enterprise version and our free open source version.

This is an exciting step for us, as we grow the team and the company and our user base. We officially became a company just last fall (I wrote about it in November 2022, in ‚ÄúNext steps for authentik‚Äù), and this release is another move forwards in growing authentik into the SSO and identity management app of choice.
One thing we want to acknowledge, up front, is that we would never be able to have achieved this goal without the years of support from our open source community. You all helped build authentik into what it is today, and that‚Äôs why even our Enterprise-level features will be open core and source available, always.
For our first enterprise release, dedicated support is the feature; this version provides access to our Support center where you can open tickets, view tickets and their progress, and ask questions about your Enterprise product.
For our OOS community, we will continue to engage in the robust conversations and problem-solving, as always, in our Discord server. These conversation and community collaboration are the heart and soul of authentik‚Ä¶ we learn from everyone, and we will always be active and responsive there within our community.
Check out our Enterprise documentation for information about creating and managing your organization, purchasing and activating a license, support, and managing billing and organization members.

In future releases, we will be adding additional Enterprise features, including RBAC support, authentication for remote desktop access, and an authentik mobile app for multi-factor authentication.
For this preview release of authentik Enterprise, we‚Äôd like to hear from you; thoughts and suggestions, questions, any specific direction that you‚Äôd like to see the Enterprise version focus on? Contact us at hello@goauthentik.
